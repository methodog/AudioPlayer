    <p begin="0:00:00">Several sculptures in this room depict images of the dead Christ. They were meant to elicit feelings of pity and sorrow in everyone who saw them — a reminder of Christ’s sacrifice for humanity.</p>
    <p begin="0:00:13">This song also focuses on the intense emotions surrounding the death of Jesus. Its lyrics are quite graphic describing the body of Christ hanging on the cross:</p>
    <p begin="0:00:24">‘to free us from original sin&lt;br&gt;And to save us from damnation&lt;br&gt;He hangs, as you can see, upon the hard wood…’</p>
    <p begin="0:00:33">The piece, called &lt;i&gt;Se mai per maraviglia,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;If ever in wonder,&lt;/i&gt; was written by Franciscus Bossinensis, known as Francis of Bosnia. He wrote many pieces for lute and voice, and this is one his most famous and moving compositions.</p>

    <p begin="0:01:09">Translation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If ever in wonder raising your face&lt;br&gt;To the clear sky you think, o blind people&lt;br&gt;Of that true lord of paradise&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turn your eyes over here, that is presented to you&lt;br&gt;Not that form oh my not that pain&lt;br&gt;That will contemplate knots of laments</p>
    <p begin="0:03:00">Weep for the great sorrow of the world&lt;br&gt;Weep for the bitter death and the cruel suffering&lt;br&gt;If the spirit of compassion pierces your heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To liberate us from the ancient deception</p>
    <p begin="0:04:40">He hangs as you see on the hard wood&lt;br&gt;And to save us from perpetual damnation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This recording was made by the Royal College of Music and was supported by an award from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.</p>
