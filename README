==========
AudioPoint
==========

Content is defined and contained in different areas, as defined by the legacy Flash system, in order to maintain backwards compatibility. 
Though this newer application will still work with all of the prexisiting XML content files, a more lightweight version of each file can be used going forward, as detailed below.

Whether modifying or creating a new AudioPoint, please start with an existing version of each XML content file, as supplied. 

## site.xml
    The file site.xml sets the title of the audio point and defines the menu of options.
    Within the <menu> section, the main title of the AudioPoint is defined, followed by an index listing of the tracks for that AudioPoint.

## videos/
    Keeping its name from the legacy system, the videos folder contains all of the audio files, together with corresponding textual transcription file for each track, e.g. track_01.xml (see below).
    In order to cater for all browsers, both MP3 & OGG versions of each audio track must be supplied. Currently, all modern browsers support either MP3 or OGG. Opera browser requires OGG. More details on which audio codecs each browser supports in future can be found by searching for "browser audio codec support" online.
#### track_01.xml
    The transcript file for each track contains all of the text, split up into paragraphs, in chunks of less than 80 words, preferably around 50 words, so as to fit reasonably into the display area.
    Each paragraph tag will be in the form: <p begin="0:00:00">, where the begin time should correspond to the time elapsed in the audio track, at which the paragraph needs to be displayed.

## timeout/
    The timeout folder contains any images to be displayed after the AudioPoint has been left inactive for a period of time. If there are more than one image supplied, they will cycle through.
#### index.xml
    Within the timeout folder, index.xml defines which of the available timeout images should be used.


N.B. When inserting any basic HTML formatting tags into textual fields within the XML, such as <i>, <br>, etc., it is important to replace the angle brackets with their character codes, i.e. 
< = &lt;
> = &gt;
so that <i>something in italics</i> becomes &lt;i&gt;something in italics&lt;/i&gt;
